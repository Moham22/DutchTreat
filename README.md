# MVC tutorial 

[![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/lonelydev/DutchTreat.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/lonelydev/DutchTreat)

As I was following Shawn Wildermuth's tutorial on Pluralsight to build an ASP.Net Core project using MVC, Entity Framework Core, Bootstrap and Angular, I thought I would keep track of my progress. 
Adding my progress to git was a good way to see how often I went through the course.

## DutchTreat

DutchTreat is the name of the application that was build as part of the tutorial. It is very simple online shop that is build to purchase art by Dutch artists online. 

The author of the course takes you through building an MVC based website using nothing but ASP .NET and bootstrap at first. 

Then goes on to introduce front end technologies like Angular to update parts of the same website and then connects the front end with the MVC API that you built earlier. 

What I was looking to learn was to productionize a simple ASP .NET Core web application on Azure and this tutorial was an excellent starting point. 

I am hoping to make further enhancements to the website like the following:

  * All of UI done in Angular
  * Unit Tests
  * Continuous integration and deployment using Cake
  * A Payment processing feature - the checkout doesn't really do anything at the moment
  * Ability to view orders associated to a user
  * Cancel an order
  * Re-order previously ordered item

I will probably get more ideas as I go on this adventure.
